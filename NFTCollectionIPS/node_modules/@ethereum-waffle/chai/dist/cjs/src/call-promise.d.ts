/**
 * Takes a chai object (usually a `this` object) and adds a `promise` property to it.
 * Adds a `response` property to the chai object with the transaction response.
 * The promised is resolved when the transaction is mined.
 * Adds a `receipt` property to the chai object with the transaction receipt when the promise is resolved.
 * May be called on a chai object which contains any of these:
 * - a transaction response
 * - a promise which resolves to a transaction response
 * - a function that returns a transaction response
 * - a function that returns a promise which resolves to a transaction response
 * - same combinations as above but query instead of transaction.
 *  Attention: some matchers require to be called on a transaction.
